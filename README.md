# My website

The complete repo of my website, which is available at <a href="https://pedrex.sbs/">https://pedrex.sbs</a>.

## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install all the necessary dependencies.
If you already have npm installed, run this command:

```bash
npm i
```

This command installs all the libraries that are necessary to run the website.

## Usage

If you already have everything installed, you can start running the backend of the website. This is easy to do, just run this command:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see this output in the console after a few moments:

```bash
Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

This means the site is up and running, and available at <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>. But, before you run it, make sure nothing else is occupying that port.
